    "The two values of the Boolean data type are \"true\" and \"false\". In programming languages, these values are typically represented using the keywords \"true\" and \"false\" or the integers 1 and 0 respectively. In some languages, such as Python, the first letter of the Boolean values is capitalized, so they are represented as \"True\" and \"False\".\n",

    "The three different types of Boolean operators are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"AND\" operator: This operator returns \"true\" if and only if both operands are \"true\". It is denoted by the symbol \"&&\" in most programming languages. For example, the expression \"A && B\" would evaluate to \"true\" only if both A and B are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"OR\" operator: This operator returns \"true\" if at least one of the operands is \"true\". It is denoted by the symbol \"||\" in most programming languages. For example, the expression \"A || B\" would evaluate to \"true\" if either A or B (or both) are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"NOT\" operator: This operator negates the value of its operand. It returns \"true\" if the operand is \"false\", and \"false\" if the operand is \"true\". It is denoted by the symbol \"!\" in most programming languages. For example, the expression \"!A\" would evaluate to \"true\" if A is false, and \"false\" if A is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean operators are commonly used in programming and computer science to create complex logical expressions that can determine the flow of a program, the outcome of a condition, or the value of a variable based on certain conditions.\n",

The first column and the second column of each table list all possible values for A and B (or just A, in the case of the NOT operator). The third column shows the result of the Boolean operation for each possible combination of A and B. \"true\" is typically represented as 1, and \"false\" is typically represented as 0.\n",

    "The \"equal to\" operator and the \"assignment\" operator are two different operators with different functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"equal to\" operator is denoted by \"==\" and it compares two values to see if they are equal. It returns a boolean value of \"true\" if the values are equal, and \"false\" otherwise. For example, the expression 2 == 2 is true because 2 is equal to 2, while 3 == 4 is false because 3 is not equal to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"assignment\" operator is denoted by \"=\" and is used to assign a value to a variable. It takes the value on the right side and assigns it to the variable on the left side. For example, the statement x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two operators can be easily distinguished by the context in which they are used. In an expression, the \"equal to\" operator is used to compare two values, while the \"assignment\" operator is used to assign a value to a variable\n",

    "If a program is stuck in an endless loop, you can try to stop the execution of the program by pressing the \"Ctrl\" and \"C\" keys simultaneously on your keyboard. This will send a keyboard interrupt signal to the program, which should stop its execution and return you to the command prompt or shell. However, note that this method may not work in all situations, especially if the program is unresponsive or has crashed. In such cases, you may need to force quit the program or restart your computer.\n",
